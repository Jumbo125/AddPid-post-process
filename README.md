# AddPid-post-process

I wrote a script for the post-processing function in cura.
You can set your perfect PID-Values for every Filament.

To choose the correct Material, only enable the correct Material checkbox.
When you shut down or restart cura, your values should be existing. So you only need to activate the Filament, you want to print.

I can't give any warranty

Hope you have fun
